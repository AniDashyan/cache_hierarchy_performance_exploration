# cache_hierarchy_performance_exploration
The following repository contains the solution to the following problem: Implement a program that accesses an array with increasing stride sizes (e.g., step 1, 16, 64, 256) and measure access times. Explain how different cache levels (L1, L2, L3) affect performance due to locality.
